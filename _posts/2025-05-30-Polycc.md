## MATH_GURU üß¨

Description : You need to solve the equation and get the flag.

Hint:Find the Equation First

Open the exe file with ghidra and make an analysis on main section and  local_14 was  initilaizing by the input make by user and on line 10 its comparing the local_14 that based on user input and compare to the 0x85 in decimal was equal to 133 and if its right it will print the flag if not equal to 133 it will print out Nope! try again.

![can u](/assets/img/133.png)

```
FLAG: ctfcw{133}
```

## EASY PASSKEY

## CRYPTOGRAPHY üîë
